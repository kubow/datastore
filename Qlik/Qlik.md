Key Terms:
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)** – Software that continuously identifies and captures incremental changes within one source and then delivers thosechanges to a replicated source (agentless & log based, only real-time on the market).
- **Data Lake** – A massive, centralized repository of large volumes of structuredand unstructured data that has been minimally transformed, if at all. Only when the data is later accessed, is it classified, organized or analyzed.
- **Data Replication** – The process of copying data from one source to another source so that all users can share the same data without any inconsistency.
- **Streaming** – Continuously delivering content to other devices or sources asopposed to scheduled (bulk or batch) transfers.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform & Load)** – The process of pulling data out of one ormore data sources, changing the form of the data (if necessary) and thenplacing it into another data repository.
- **Data Warehouse Automation** – An evolution from traditional ETL, it provides automation and optimizations from designing the warehouse, to generating ETL code, to quickly applying updates, all leveraging best practices and provendesign patterns.

- **Data Preparation** (to collect and refine data, then stream to cloud/data lake for real-time) consist of:
    - blending
    - cleansing
    - filtering
    - aggregating
    - enhancing
- **DataOps Catalog**:
    - organizing
    - documenting
    - describing

Data Analytics

1. Generation - Centralized IT
2. Generation - Data Discovery, Decentralized, examine freely data, no data strategy
3. Generation - Democratized, Support every person, Data driven decissions

Creating connected strategy:

1. Data - Agile Data Delivery, Universal Access (Inflexible Tools, Many Platforms)
2. Analytics - Analytics Ready (Script-Intensive approach)
3. Insignths - Real-Time (ETL bottlenecks, Ungoverned)

BI Plateau - Adoption of Resources, Data Literacy and Guidance + Expertise
