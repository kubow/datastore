**Lifecycle of data in SAC**: Data used in SAC can be located either on a cloud server, on a physical server at the customerâ€™s location, or a combination of the two. Regardless of where the data is located, SAP Analytics Cloud provides data preparation, simulation, forecasting, and storytelling capabilities for the data.

Data Implementation Workflow:
1. Identify your data sources
2. Decide on whether to acquire data or use live data. Consider performance/security/planning/smart predict/ammount of data stored in a story/is data wrangling needed
3. Connect to SAC
4. Create live models for live data
5. IF data acquisition: Create public dimensions and import master data (create models and import transaction data)
6. Create stories and analytic apps

### Data Connections

- **Live Connections** (data stored exclusively in customer's database, security inherited, virtual models created in SAC)
	- Direct Connection
		- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
		- End-to-end SSO via SAML
	- Tunnel Connection
		- Some of data exposed, CORS is not required
		- Not supported for live connection to universes
- **Import Data Connections** (data imported (replicated) from customer's database)
	- Data duplicated (and Persistent Model saved)
	- Security in SAC controls data access
	- Leverages full SAP Analytics Cloud capabilities such as planning and smart predict
	- Best for data preparation and data blending scenarios
- Export Data Connections

The **SAP Analytics Cloud Agent** is an on-premise data connectivity component that is used to:
- Import data connections from SAP Business Planning and Consolidation, version for Microsoft Platform (BPC MS).
- Import data connections from SAP Business Warehouse (BW).
- Import data connections from SAP Universes.
- Import data connections from SAP ERP.
- Import data connections to an SQL database.
- Import data from a file server.


### Metadata

**Connection Definition** (No user and password are stored in SAC live connection description)
**Model Definition** (Data or dimension value from data sources are not stored in SAP Analytics Cloud, except values of filters and input controls used in query, if any)
**Story Definition** (Data or dimension value from data sources are not stored in SAP Analytics Cloud, except values of filters and input controls used in query, if any)

### Dimensions


### Data Transformation

### Model Types
SAP Analytics Cloud recognizes the following styles of models:
- Planning Model
	- preconfigured with dimensions for time and version
	- offer support for multi-currency and security features at the level of both model and dimension
	- when working with a planning model in a story, users with planning privileges can create their own versions of model data
	- users can also write data to the model by typing new values, copying and pasting data, and using data actions
- Analytics Model
	- unlike the planning model, the analytics model does not support versions and does not require a time dimension
	- used for stories and analytic applications that are read-only, for data presentation and analysis purposes
