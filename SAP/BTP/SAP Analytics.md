SAP Analytics Cloud has capabilities:
- end-to-end analytics experience that simplifies complex work flows with one solution, allowing businesses to transition easily from insights, to plan, to action.
- Be big data-ready and scale to grow as your business does.

The benefits of SAP Analytics Cloud are as follows:
- Analyze, predict, and plan in one experience across all devices.
- Make end-to-end decisions with data management and analytics together in one place.
- Scale to meet the needs of your business and diverse users across all decision types (strategic, operational, and tactical).

SAC can also help your business make smarter decisions faster with AI-driven insights by seamlessly integrating AI technologies such as Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Query (NLQ), and Natural Language Generation (NLG). The capabilities of this technology include:
- NLQ/NLG as the primary interface to find the right content and key insights (Smart Insights and Search to Insight).
- ML algorithms applied to guided data discovery, and key influence and pattern detection (Smart Discovery).
- ML algorithms to leverage historical data to build predictions with no data scientist required (Smart Predict).

The benefits of this technology include:
- Being able to ask questions in a conversational manner with instant results explained in natural language.
- Detecting drivers of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) and taking the next best action using automated ML that discovers unknown relationships in data.
- Predicting potential outcomes and forecasts with the push of a button.
