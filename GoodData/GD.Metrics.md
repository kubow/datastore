- Calculation made on top of the underlying data. 
- Allows to create standartizes set of calculations that build on top of each other.
- Aim is to make it available even without neccesity of knowing SQL.

## Using an API to create a metric

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/entities/workspaces/demo/metrics \
  -H "Content-Type: application/vnd.gooddata.api+json" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.gooddata.api+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YWRtaW46Ym9vdHN0cmFwOmFkbWluMTIz" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{ 
    "data": {
       "id": "Metric1",
       "type": "metric",
       "attributes": {
         "title": "Sum of Campaign Spend",
         "description": "Sum of total campaign spend",
         "content": {
           "format": "0.00",
           "maql": "SELECT SUM({fact/campaign_channels.spend})"
          }
        }
      }
    }'
